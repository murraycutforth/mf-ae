# Multiphase flow autoencoder

## Overview
A research codebase for investigating the dimensionality reduction of the indicator function in multiphase flow
data, using autoencoders. We are interested in the effect of different interface representations here, such as sharp/diffuse/level set.

## Dependencies
Detailed in requirements.txt file: `pip install -r requirements.txt` 
- Standard ML Python libraries
- 3D AE implementation at: https://github.com/murraycutforth/conv-ae-3d
